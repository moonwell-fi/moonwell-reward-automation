# Product Context: Moonwell Reward Automation

## Problem Definition

The Moonwell protocol operates across three different blockchain networks (Moonbeam, Base, and Optimism), each with its own unique market dynamics, token economics, and incentive structures. Managing liquidity incentives across these networks involves complex calculations that must:

1. **Balance rewards fairly** across all markets based on size, utilization, and strategic importance
2. **Update regularly** as market conditions change
3. **Follow network-specific rules** for distributing both WELL tokens and native tokens
4. **Consider multiple reward mechanisms** (lending markets, safety modules, DEX incentives)
5. **Maintain transparency** for governance participants who approve these distributions

Traditionally, this would require manual calculations, spreadsheets, and significant human effort prone to errors and inefficiencies.

## Solution

The Moonwell Reward Automation system solves these problems by:

1. **Automating data collection** from on-chain sources across all networks
2. **Applying standardized algorithms** to calculate optimal reward distributions
3. **Generating both technical and human-friendly outputs** for implementation
4. **Supporting configurable parameters** allowing for strategic adjustments
5. **Ensuring consistency** in reward calculations across epochs

## User Experience Goals

### For Protocol Administrators
- Reduce time spent on reward calculations from hours to minutes
- Minimize errors in reward distributions
- Enable quick responses to changing market conditions
- Provide clear documentation for governance proposals

### For Governance Participants
- Transparent understanding of reward distribution logic
- Clear visibility into changes from previous reward rates
- Access to comprehensive market data supporting decisions

### For Protocol Users
- Predictable reward distribution mechanisms
- Fair allocation of incentives across markets
- Regular updates to optimize for changing conditions

## Key Differentiators

1. **Cross-Chain Design**: Unlike single-chain solutions, handles the complexity of three different networks simultaneously
2. **Comprehensive Output**: Generates both JSON for programmatic use and Markdown for human decision-making
3. **Configurable Ratios**: Flexible allocation parameters allow for strategic adjustments without code changes
4. **Safety Module & DEX Integration**: Goes beyond simple market rewards to handle all protocol incentive mechanisms

## Success Metrics

1. **Accuracy**: Calculations match expected distributions and balance across networks
2. **Efficiency**: Time saved compared to manual processes
3. **Governance Approval**: Acceptance rate of proposals generated by the system
4. **Error Reduction**: Fewer corrections or adjustments needed after implementation
5. **Adaptability**: Ability to accommodate network changes or new incentive structures

## User Workflows

### Weekly/Bi-weekly Incentive Updates
1. Administrator initiates calculation with timestamp
2. System fetches on-chain data from all networks
3. Reward calculations are performed based on configuration
4. JSON and Markdown outputs are generated
5. Outputs are reviewed by governance participants
6. Approved changes are implemented on-chain via transactions

By automating this process, the system ensures that Moonwell's incentive structure remains optimized, fair, and transparent across all supported networks.
