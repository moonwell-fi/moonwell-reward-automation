# Progress: Moonwell Reward Automation

## What Works

The Moonwell Reward Automation system is currently operational with all core functionality implemented. The following components are working as intended:

### 1. Market Data Collection
- âœ… Cross-network data fetching from Moonbeam, Base, and Optimism
- âœ… Closest block number calculation for timestamp consistency
- âœ… Price retrieval from on-chain oracles
- âœ… Supply, borrow, and exchange rate data collection
- âœ… Current reward speed retrieval
- âœ… Safety module data collection

### 2. Reward Calculation
- âœ… Network-based allocation percentages
- âœ… Market-specific supply and borrow ratios
- âœ… Handling of boost and deboost parameters
- âœ… Calculation of new emission speeds
- âœ… APR/APY conversions
- âœ… Minimum reward speed handling (e.g., 1e-18)

### 3. Output Generation
- âœ… JSON format for programmatic consumption
- âœ… Markdown format for governance proposals
- âœ… Network-specific output structures
- âœ… Percentage change calculations
- âœ… USD conversion for reward values

### 4. Additional Features
- âœ… Reserve management operations
- âœ… Safety module emissions calculation
- âœ… DEX incentive allocation
- âœ… Multi-token reward handling (WELL + native tokens)
- âœ… Bridge cost estimation for cross-chain transfers

## What's Left to Build

While the core system is functional, several enhancements could improve the system:

### 1. Infrastructure Improvements
- ðŸ”² Caching layer for frequently accessed data
- ðŸ”² Performance optimizations for large RPC request batches
- ðŸ”² Historical data storage and retrieval capabilities
- ðŸ”² Monitoring and alerting system

### 2. Feature Expansions
- ðŸ”² Configuration management UI
- ðŸ”² Automated testing of reward distribution results
- ðŸ”² Simulation capabilities for parameter adjustments
- ðŸ”² Analytics dashboard for reward distribution trends

### 3. Documentation Enhancements
- ðŸ”² Enhanced API documentation
- ðŸ”² System architecture diagrams
- ðŸ”² Onboarding guide for new maintainers
- ðŸ”² Protocol integration documentation

## Current Status

The system is **fully operational** as a Cloudflare Worker API service. It successfully handles:

1. Real-time calculation of reward distributions
2. Generation of governance proposal content
3. Production of JSON instructions for on-chain execution
4. Cross-network data collection and processing

Recent additions to the system include:
- Handling of reserves automation
- Support for safety module boosting with auction proceeds
- Enhanced error detection for zero prices
- Network-specific rounding and precision handling

The API endpoints can be accessed at:
- JSON format: `/?type=json&timestamp=<UNIX_TIMESTAMP>&network=<NETWORK_NAME>`
- Markdown format: `/?type=markdown&timestamp=<UNIX_TIMESTAMP>&proposal=<PROPOSAL_NUMBER>&network=<NETWORK_NAME>`

## Known Issues

Several known limitations and issues exist in the current implementation:

1. **Performance Constraints**:
   - Large multicall requests can approach Cloudflare Worker time limits
   - Sequential cross-chain data fetching creates longer response times

2. **Error Handling Edge Cases**:
   - Zero prices in oracles require special handling
   - Markets with zero supply/borrow can create division-by-zero risks

3. **Configuration Management**:
   - Configuration changes require code deployment
   - No validation system for configuration parameters

4. **Network-Specific Quirks**:
   - Moonbeam's older comptroller architecture requires different handling
   - Base's USDC has 6 decimals vs 18 for other reward tokens
   - Optimism reward contract has unique parameter requirements

5. **Blockchain Communication**:
   - RPC endpoints can be unstable or rate-limited
   - Large multicall batches occasionally fail and need retry logic

## Evolution of Project Decisions

The system has evolved through several key decisions and adjustments:

### Initial Design (v0.1)
- Simple reward calculation based solely on TVL ratios
- Single output format (JSON)
- Moonbeam network only

### Market-Specific Parameters (v0.2)
- Added boost/deboost configuration
- Introduced supply/borrow split ratios
- Enhanced error handling

### Cross-Network Support (v0.3)
- Added Base and Optimism networks
- Implemented chain-specific adapters
- Created unified market data model

### Output Format Expansion (v0.4)
- Added Markdown governance proposal format
- Enhanced metric calculations
- Implemented percentage change tracking

### Enhanced Features (Current)
- Reserve automation functionality
- Safety module boosting with auction proceeds
- DEX incentive allocation
- Zero price detection and handling
- Minimum reward speed standardization

### Future Directions
- Move toward parallel data fetching
- Implement caching for improved performance
- Develop configuration management UI
- Add historical data capabilities

The system continues to evolve to meet the changing needs of the Moonwell protocol's multi-chain incentive structure, with particular focus on maintaining calculation accuracy, improving performance, and enhancing usability for protocol administrators.
